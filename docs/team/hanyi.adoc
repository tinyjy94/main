== PROJECT: MoVie Planner (MVP) - V1.5rc

---

== Overview

MoVie Planner (MVP) - is a desktop movie planner built to streamline a theater manager's job by managing schedules of movies in different cinemas. It also has features such as encryption and emailing. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoc.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to find movies by different predicates*
** What it does: allows the user to choose different parameters to search.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to narrow down the search result significantly if the movie database is  huge. This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: The current implementation is using `and` for parameters to make the search stricter in order to filter away unwanted results. This feature could be further built on to allow a broader search, for example allowing the user to specify `and` or `or` in their input. This will increase the flexibility of the search function in our application.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the Movie class with various parameters to allow integration with screenings.
