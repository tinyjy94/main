== Introduction

MoVie Planner (MVP) is a desktop application that aims to assist cinema managers in managing schedule of
movies in different cinemas, providing features such as replicating cinemas’ schedules across periods of
time, secure storage of cinema schedule and more.

This guide provides information that will help you get started as a MVP contributor. In particular,
the guide details the design of our backend architecture, implementation of features, and the testing
methods used in our development.

<<DeveloperGuide.adoc#, Back to top>>


== Setting up

To get you started, ensure that the following requirements are met:

=== Prerequisites

Please install the following:

. *Java SE Development Kit* (JDK) `1.8.0_60` or later

You can download the latest JDK version http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here].

[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

. *IntelliJ IDEA* Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You can download IntelliJ IDEA https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[here].

[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. *Fork* this repo, and *clone* the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the following command:
.. Windows: `gradlew processResources`
.. Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`

[NOTE]
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `src\main\java\seedu\address\MainApp.java` and try a few commands such as <<UserGuide#,add>>,
<<UserGuide#,delete>>, <<UserGuide#,list>>, etc.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configuring MVP before writing codes

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

[TIP]
Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B2/main/` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B2/main/`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

You should set up Travis and AppVeyor to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

<<DeveloperGuide.adoc#, Back to top>>

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of MVP. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for the following:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to MVP's log file.

The rest of MVP consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of MVP.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of MVP in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteCinema.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `MoviePlannerChangedEvent` when the Movie Planner data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteCinemaEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The `Ui` component provides the API of <<graphical-user-interface, Graphical User Interface>>. Figure 5 shows
the structure of the `Ui` component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CinemaListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `Ui` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `Ui` component is responsible for the following:

* Executing user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binding itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responding to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component deals with how each command and respective parser are executed in an event-driven design.
Figures 6 and 7 shows the structure of the `Logic` component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MoviePlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a cinema) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 8 shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteCinemaSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` component manages cinemas and movies in MVP, providing _APIs_ to create, read, update and delete.
Figure 9 shows the structure of the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component is responsible for the following:

* storing a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* storing the Movie Planner data.
* exposing an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Cinema>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* not dependent on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` component handles the storage of all data of MVP in the local device. Figure 10 shows the
structure of the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component is responsible for the following:

* saving `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* saving the Movie Planner data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu\address\commons` package.

<<DeveloperGuide.adoc#, Back to top>>

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the movie planner (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

*Current Implementation*

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. Figure 11 shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

*Undoable Commands*

.Inheritance diagram for commands
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`.

[NOTE]
====
* Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the movie planner before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command.
* Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].
====

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th cinema in MVP. The current state of the MVP is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).
Figure 12 illustrates the procedure.

.Diagram of UndoRedoStack before and after delete command
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/Cathay ...` to add a new cinema as shown in Figure 13.

.Diagram of UndoRedoStack before and after add command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the cinema was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore MVP to its previous state before the `add` command was executed, as shown in Figure 14.

.Diagram of UndoRedoStack before and after undo command
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram of Undo Command
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores MVP to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/Cathay` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Diagram of UndoRedoStack before and after clear command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Diagram of UndoRedoStack before and after list command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Figure 18 summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Activity Diagram of UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It will be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: It does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire movie planner.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the cinema being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the movie planner (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data Encryption/Decryption
MVP provides data encryption as well as decryption to allow for safe storage and transmission of data.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `encrypt pw/pass`.

.Component interactions for `encrypt pw/pass` command (part 1)
image::SDforEncryption.png[width="800"]

Figure 20 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk.

.Component interactions for `encrypt pw/pass` command (part 2)
image::SDforEncryptEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
`Decrypt` command also follows the same flow as shown in the Sequence Diagram above, but `DecryptionRequestEvent` is posted and `handleDecryptionRequestEvent` is called instead.

==== Implementation details
`SecurityUtil` is used to facilitate the encryption and decryption process by providing the `encrypt` and `decrypt` commands.

. When `encrypt pw/<password>` or `decrypt pw/<password>` command is entered by the user, `EncryptionRequestEvent` or `DecryptionRequestEvent` will be posted to the `EventsCenter` respectively.
. `StorageManager` will then trigger `SecurityUtil` to perform the `encrypt` or `decrypt` command.
. `generateKey()` and `processFile()` methods within `SecurityUtil` will then be executed to perform writing of files.
. `encrypt` will create/overwrite an `encryptedmovieplanner.xml` by encrypting the data from `movieplanner.xml` using the password provided by the user.
. `decrypt` will create/overwrite a `movieplanner.xml` by decrypting the data from `encryptedmovieplanner.xml` using the password provided by the user.

[NOTE]
====
* If the user enters a different password that was used to encrypt the file when decrypting, an error will be shown on the `CommandBox`.
* `encrypt` and `decrypt` command can be performed repeatedly to overwrite the xml files.
====


==== Design Considerations

*Aspect:* How to generate key

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generating the key using password input by user

** Pros: Users can customise their own passwords.
** Cons: It might not be secured as users would probably use a weak password.

* **Alternative 2:** Generating the key using `java.crypto.KeyGenerator`

** Pros: Password is quite strong, so even if outsiders were to obtain the data file, they would require tremendous effort to decrypt it.
** Cons: Users cannot customise their own passwords.

*Aspect:* Where to save password

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users remember the password themselves

** Pros: As the password is not stored anywhere in the application, unauthorized personnel would not be able to reverse-engineer the application to obtain the password.
** Cons: User will have to inform the other party about the password themselves through some secured means.

* **Alternative 2:** Password saved in application

** Pros: Password is not lost every time the application is started up.

** Cons: Password could be reversed-engineered from the application, which defeats the purpose of encryption.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of MVP.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the MVP.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Email feature

The email feature is facilitated by the `Email` component. It supports the sending of email through an external library `JavaMail`.

*Current Implementation*

MVP uses the email command to send an email. The following activity diagram displays the series of events that occurs when a user enters the email
command.

.Activity Diagram of Email feature
image::EmailActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The email feature is constructed by 3 classes, `EmailLogin`, `EmailCompose`, `EmailSend`, which is handled by the `EmailManager`. More
details about the classes are as provided:

* `EmailLogin`: Handles the storage of login information and verifies whether the user is using a Gmail account to access
the email feature.
* `EmailCompose`: Handles the email composing and drafting using a `MessageDraft` object to store email information such
as message, subject and recipient email.
* `EmailSend`: Handles the sending of email by setting up a SMTP connection through the JavaMail API. The email cannot be sent if
the following criteria are not met:
 ** the`MessageDraft` object in `EmailCompose` is empty or,
 ** the login details in `EmailLogin` is not valid.

The following sequence diagram shows how each component interacts when the email command is entered by the user.

.Sequence Diagram of Email feature
image::EmailUMLDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how each component within the `EmailManager` interacts when the email command
is entered by the user.

.Sequence Diagram of Email feature
image::EmailSendUMLDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following diagram shows how the email draft tab in the MVP UI is updated when the `EventCenter` responds to the
`EmailDraftChangedEvent`.

.Sequence Diagram of Email feature
image::EmailEventsDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Implementation of JavaMail API*

The `Email` component uses the external library `JavaMail` to handle sending out of email from MVP. The following
code snippet below shows the set up (via SMTP) for sending out email.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Sets up the default email properties
 */
private void setUpEmailProperties() {
    props = new Properties();
    props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
    props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.port", "465");
    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.class", "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory");
    props.put("mail.smtp.port", "465");
}

/**
 * Sends email out using JavaMail API
 *
 * @param login email login account
 * @param pass email login password
 * @param message message to send
 * @throws AuthenticationFailedException if gmail account can't be logged in
 */
 private void sendingEmail(String login, String pass, ReadOnlyMessageDraft message)
        throws AuthenticationFailedException {
    final String username = login;
    final String password = pass;

    Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
        @Override
        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
            return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
        }
    });

    try {
        Message newMessage = new MimeMessage(session);
        newMessage.setFrom(new InternetAddress(username));
        InternetAddress recipientEmail = new InternetAddress(message.getRecipient());
        newMessage.setRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, recipientEmail);
        newMessage.setSubject(message.getSubject());
        if (message.getRelativeFilePath().isEmpty()) {
            newMessage.setText(message.getMessage());
        } else {
            BodyPart messageBodyPart = new MimeBodyPart();
            messageBodyPart.setText(message.getMessage());
            Multipart multipart = new MimeMultipart();
            multipart.addBodyPart(messageBodyPart);
            messageBodyPart = new MimeBodyPart();
            DataSource source = new FileDataSource(message.getRelativeFilePath());
            messageBodyPart.setDataHandler(new DataHandler(source));
            messageBodyPart.setFileName(message.getRelativeFilePath());
            multipart.addBodyPart(messageBodyPart);
            newMessage.setContent(multipart);
        }

        Transport.send(newMessage);
    } catch (AuthenticationFailedException e) {
        throw new AuthenticationFailedException();
    } catch (MessagingException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
----

*Design Considerations*

*Aspect:* Implementation of email feature

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Adopt JavaMail API

* *Pros:* The email feature will be integrated within the MVP application.
* *Cons:* The email is less secured.

*Alternative 2:* Link users to other email platforms

* *Pros:* Users will have more options in editing email information.
* *Cons:* The email feature will not be integrated within the MVP application.

[[Implementation-FindMovie]]
=== Enhanced FindMovie command

The user can find movies by `Category`, `MovieName` or `StartDate` or a combination of them as a multicriteria search.

==== Implementation details

The parser will take in all arguments the user specified and store it in an array. If the user search by `MovieName` or
`StartDate` or `Category`, MVP will retrieve movie records in the storage with the matching keywords. If two or more conditions
are specified, MVP will combine the predicates to get a smaller subset of results.

==== Finding commands

Movies can be found by using the `findmovie` command. The command is parsed by `FindMovieCommandParser` and be executed
in `FindMovieCommand`.

Figure below shows the interaction between the classes.

*Finding by `MovieName` or/and `StartDate` or/and `Tag`*

.Sequence diagram of findmovie command
image::FindMovieSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="1000"]

==== Implementation details
As seen in the sequence diagram above, MVP will do the following

. Calls `arePrefixesPresent()` to check if the necessary prefixes n/, sd/ and t/, which are used for name, startDate and tag
respectively are present.

. Calls `tokenize` method in `ArgumentTokenizer` to get value entered by user.

. Based on the `parameters` input by the user, `FindMovieCommand` will take in different predicates to get the correct result.
The code snippet below shows when all parameters are chosen.

[source, java]
if (!argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_NAME).isEmpty()
    && !argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_STARTDATE).isEmpty()
    && !argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_TAG).isEmpty()) {
    //name, startDate, tag present
    nameValues = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME).get();
    startDateValues = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_STARTDATE).get();
    tagValues = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_TAG).get();
    nameKeywords = nameValues.split("\\s+");
    startDateKeywords = startDateValues.split("\\s+");
    tagKeywords = tagValues.split("\\s+");
    return new FindMovieCommand(new NameAndStartDateAndTagContainsKeywordsPredicate
    (Arrays.asList(nameKeywords), Arrays.asList(startDateKeywords), Arrays.asList(tagKeywords)));
} else if ... //other parameters combination

. `FindMovieCommand` then returns `CommandResult` to the user which shows the current status of the `Cinema`.
[NOTE]
`parameters` above refers to parameters provided by the user. E.g. name only or name and tag

==== Design considerations
*Aspects:* Using `and` or `or` condition for the multicriteria search.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using `and` condition for multicriteria search
** Pros: User will be able to make a more detailed search to display on MVP.
** Cons: User cannot do a wider search with multiple keywords

* **Alternative 2:** Using `or` condition for multicriteria search
** Pros: User can search for multiple `tag` for example to find movies of those categories.
** Cons: User will not be able to make a detailed search to narrow down the results displayed on MVP.

[NOTE]
A future update is planned in `V2.0` to support both `and` and `or` functions in the FindMovie command

[[Implementation-SchedulingSystem]]
=== Scheduling System

In MVP, the scheduling system enables the user to plan a schedule of the cinema's theater via addition and removal of screenings.
The user can then use the `BrowserPanel` to view the cinema's schedule.

==== Implementation details

Addition and removal of screenings uses similar implementation. The sequence diagram below shows an overview
of the high level interactions between components for the scenario when a `addscreening` command issued.

[[high_level_sd_scheduling]]
image::SDForAddScreening.png[width="1000"]

===== Add Screening Command

MVP makes use of the `addscreening` command to add a new screening to a cinema's theater.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions inside the Logic Component
for `addscreening` command.

.Sequence diagram of the interactions inside the Logic Component for `addscreening` command
image::AddScreeningSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

As seen in the sequence diagram above, MVP will do the following to execute the `addscreening` command

. `LogicManager` calls the `MoviePlannerParser` to parse the user command.
. `MoviePlannerParser` calls the `AddScreeningCommandParser` to process the prefixes `c/, m/, th/, h/`, which stands for
cinema index, movie, theater number and date time respectively.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by `LogicManager`.
. `isValidScreening()` in `AddScreeningCommand` ensures a couple of properties before creating a `Screening` object.
... The movie index provided is valid.
... The cinema index provided is valid.
... The theater number provided is valid.
... The screening can fit into existing theater schedule.
... The screening date is not before the release date of the movie.

The code snippet below shows how MVP checks if the screening is valid.

[source, java]
----
    private boolean isValidScreening() throws CommandException {
        movie = getValidMovie();
        cinema = getValidCinema();
        theater = getValidTheater(cinema);
        ArrayList<Screening> screeningList = theater.getScreeningList();
        toAddScreeningEndDateTime = getEndTime();

        return isSlotAvailable(screeningList) && canAddMovie(movie);
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
* The formula used to calculate the screening's end time is (start time + movie's duration + preparation delay) rounded up to the nearest 5 minutes.
* By default the preparation delay is *15 minutes*.
* E.g. Screening is scheduled to start at 13:30, movie's duration is 93 minutes.
The end time of this screening is calculated by (13:30 + 15 minutes + 93 minutes) = 15:18.
By rounding up to the nearest 5 minutes, the screening will end at 15:20.
====

[start = 4]
. The command execution can affect the `Model` as it updates the `Cinema` object to include the new `Screening`.
. The result of the execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

===== Storing screenings to xml

Once a `Screening` is added to a cinema's theater, the `Cinema` needs to be updated and
saved into XML format.

The part in red border below shows the class diagram of the storage component
and the relationship between `XMLAdaptedCinema`, `XMLAdaptedTheater` and `XMLAdaptedScreening`.

.Class diagram of storage component
[[screening_storage]]
image::ScreeningStorageComponent.png[width="500"]
The data will be stored as such in the movieplanner.xml file:
[source, xml]
    <cinemas>
        <name>Cathay</name>
        ...
        <theater number="1"/>
        <theater number="2">
            <screening>
                <movie>Finding Nemo</movie>
                <startDateTime>11/11/2015 13:35</startDateTime>
                <endDateTime>11/11/2015 15:50</endDateTime>
            </screening>
        </theater>
    </cinemas>
    <cinemas>
        <name>Shaws</name>
        ...
        <theater number="1">
            <screening>
                <movie>Incredible Hulk</movie>
                <startDateTime>11/11/2015 13:35</startDateTime>
                <endDateTime>11/11/2015 15:50</endDateTime>
            </screening>
        </theater>
    </cinemas>

===== Reading screenings from `movieplanner.xml`

As shown in <<screening_storage>>, it shows the relationship between `XMLAdaptedCinema`, `XMLAdaptedTheater` and `XMLAdaptedScreening`.

The following steps show how MVP extracts the list of cinemas and converts the `XMLAdaptedScreening` back into
screening object.

. In `XMLAdaptedCinema`, an ArrayList is created to store the `XMLAdaptedTheater`, this ArrayList contains theaters in a cinema.

[source, java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedCinema {
    @XmlElement(name = "theater")
    private ArrayList<XmlAdaptedTheater> theaters = new ArrayList<>();
    ...
}
----
. In `XMLAdaptedTheater`, an ArrayList is created to store the `XMLAdaptedScreening`,
this ArrayList contains screenings in a theater. It also creates the `Screening` object to be stored in the `Theater`.

[source, java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedTheater {
    @XmlAttribute(name = "number")
    private int theaterNumber;
    @XmlElement(name = "screening")
    private ArrayList<XmlAdaptedScreening> screenings = new ArrayList<>();
    ...

    public Theater toModelType() throws IllegalValueException {
        ...
        Theater theater = new Theater(theaterNumber);
        for (XmlAdaptedScreening s : screenings) {
            // logic to create a screening object
            theater.addScreeningToTheater(screening);
        }
        ...
        return theater;
    }
    ...
}
----
. In `XMLAdaptedScreening`, it will read the movie name, the start and end date time of a screening.

[source, java]
----
public class XMLAdaptedScreening {
    @XmlElement(required = true, name = "movie")
    private String movieName;
    @XmlElement(required = true, name = "startDateTime")
    private String screeningDateTime;
    @XmlElement(required = true, name = "endDateTime")
    private String screeningEndDateTime;
    ...
}
----

===== Displaying screenings on UI

[TIP]
`BrowserPanel` uses the CalendarFX API to display the cinema's schedule. You can refer to http://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html to find out more about CalendarFX.

Once a screening is added to a cinema's theater, the user can view the screening on the `BrowserPanel`.
As seen in the diagram below, the `BrowserPanel` shows the schedule of a cinema.

image::BrowserPanelDisplay.png[width="800"]

Extending on <<high_level_sd_scheduling>>, the following sequence diagram shows how the UI is notified on a new screening.

image::SDForAddScreeningEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
`BrowserPanel` subscribes to the `ReloadBrowserPanel` and will load all the schedules of the cinema in MVP.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Displaying cinema theater's schedule

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an external framework such as `CalendarFX` to display the schedule
** Pros: `CalendarFX` is visually appealing and there are a lot of functionalities such as the ability to add an entry with date and time.
** Cons: Requires some time to be familiar with the API.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `JavaFX` to display the schedule
** Pros: `JavaFX` is well documented.
** Cons: Lacks calendar specific functionalities such as the ability to add an entry with date and time.

*Aspect:* Edit command for screenings

* **Alternative 1:** Implement an edit command for screening
** Pros: User can edit their screenings to their preferred date and timing.
** Cons: Edit command may introduce potential problems such as verifying a screening can be edited to another timeslot.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use existing command `deletescreening` and `addscreening` to perform an edit equivalent action
** Pros: Less commands for the user to learn about.
** Cons: User will need to delete existing screening and add the screening with new details to perform an edit equivalent action.

=== Add/Delete Theater
When creating a new `Cinema`, the initial number of theaters must be stated. This value will be used to create a corresponding number of `Theater`, which is stored as an ArrayList<Theater> in `Cinema`.

==== Implementation details
*Add Theater Command*

When there is a need to resize the `Cinema`, the user can use `addTheater` and `deleteTheater` commands to increase/decrease the number of theaters respectively.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions inside the Logic Component for `addTheater` command.

.Sequence diagram of addTheater Command
image::AddTheaterSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

[NOTE]
`deleteTheater` follows the same flow as the diagram shown above, but uses `DeleteTheaterCommand` and `DeleteTheaterCommandParser` instead.

The addition and deletion of `Theater` in `Cinema` are facilitated by `addTheater` and `deleteTheater` commands. When executing these commands, MVP will do the following

. Calls `tokenize` method in `ArgumentTokenizer` to get value entered by user.
. Calls `parseIndex` and `parseTheaters` methods in `ParserUtil` to parse input into objects required for `addTheater` command and checks for invalid format of user input.
. Creates a `AddTheaterCommand` object to take in the `parameters`. Checks are present in `AddTheaterCommand` to ensure values provided by user is valid.
. `AddTheaterCommand` then returns a `Command` object to the `LogicManager` for it to execute.
. The `LogicManager` will then create the newly resized cinema and update the `Model`.
. Upon success, the result of this execution will then be returned as a `CommandResult` object back to the UI.
[NOTE]
`parameters` above refers to parameters provided by the user. E.g. Index and number of theaters

==== Design Consideration
Aspect: Implementation of `addTheater` and `deleteTheater`

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Using `addTheater` and `deleteTheater` commands to add and remove theaters respectively
** Pros: Users will be clear that they are increasing or decreasing the size of cinema, as compared to previous implementation where the number of theaters is just overwritten in the `EditCommand`.
** Cons: Each respective command only does an action, thus two commands are required instead of one.

* *Alternative 2:* Reusing the existing `editCommand` to add or delete theaters
** Pros: A single command is needed to increase and reduce number of theaters in cinema.
** Cons: Overwrites current value of `Theater` in cinema, which might cause the user to lose information in theater.

== Documentation

Documentation for MVP are done in acsiidoc.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

Tests play a vital role in the development of MVP as they guarantee that features are working as
intended. They also ensure that the newly added features do not conflict with existing ones.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

Open a console and run the command:

* Windows: `gradlew clean allTests`
* Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command:

* Windows: `gradlew clean headless allTests`
* Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test MVP by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu\address\ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu\address\commons\StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu\address\storage\StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu\address\logic\LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

<<DeveloperGuide.adoc#, Back to top>>

== Development Operations

Automation and CI tools play a vital role in MVP's development process. They help to run tests automatically
to identify integration problems in MVP's development by ensuring that MVP is not undermined as new
features are added.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

MVP depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives:

. Including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
. Requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

<<DeveloperGuide.adoc#, Back to top>>

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all cinemas in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MoviePlannerParser.java[`MoviePlannerParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MoviePlannerParser.java[`MoviePlannerParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the movie planner, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the movie planner.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MoviePlanner.java[`MoviePlanner`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MoviePlanner.java[`MoviePlanner`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Cinema.java[`Cinema`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MoviePlanner.java[`MoviePlanner`] allows you to update a cinema, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Cinema.java[`Cinema`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MoviePlanner.java[`MoviePlanner`]. Loop through each cinema, and remove the `tag` from each cinema.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `MoviePlanner#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MoviePlanner.java[`MoviePlanner`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your movie planner application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last cinema in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside cinema cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CinemaCard.java[the `CinemaCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `CinemaCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/MoviePlannerSystemTest.java[`MoviePlannerSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and MoviePlannerSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.
****

. Modify the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to show the total number of people in the movie planner.

+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the movie planner is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of cinemas when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleMoviePlannerChangedEvent(MoviePlannerChangedEvent)`] to update the number of cinemas whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/MoviePlannerSystemTest.java[`MoviePlannerSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of cinemas status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the movie planner to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the movie planner after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the movie planner storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupMoviePlanner(ReadOnlyMoviePlanner)`, so that the movie planner can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/MoviePlannerStorage.java[`MoviePlannerStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlMoviePlannerStorage.java[`XmlMoviePlannerStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a cinema specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first cinema to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first cinema.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MoviePlannerParser.java[`MoviePlannerParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MoviePlannerParserTest.java[`MoviePlannerParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MoviePlannerParser.java[`MoviePlannerParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MoviePlannerParserTest.java[`MoviePlannerParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `CinemaCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CinemaCard.java[`CinemaCard`] s to display a remark for each cinema later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/CinemaListCard.fxml[`CinemaListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CinemaCard.java[`CinemaCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/CinemaCardHandle.java[`CinemaCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Cinema.java[`Cinema`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Cinema` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Cinema.java[`Cinema`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Cinema.java[`Cinema`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the cinema will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedCinema` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Cinema` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedCinema.java[`XmlAdaptedCinema`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidCinemaMoviePlanner.xml`, `typicalCinemasMoviePlanner.xml`, `validMoviePlanner.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `CinemaBuilder`
Since `Cinema` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/CinemaBuilder.java[`CinemaBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cinema/Cinema.java[`Cinema`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/CinemaBuilder.java[`CinemaBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the cinema that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Cinema` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalCinemas.java[`TypicalCinemas`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `CinemaCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CinemaCard.java[`CinemaCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CinemaCard.java[`CinemaCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Cinema` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysCinema(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a cinema.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
