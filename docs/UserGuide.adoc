== Introduction

MoVie Planner is for cinema managers who *prefer to use a desktop application to manage cinemas' schedules*. More importantly, MVP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MVP can get your scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

This User Guide provides an overview of available features, how to use them, and aims to help you get
started in MVP. Features are explained in detail to demonstrate how you can use it efficiently.
You will be able to understand this User Guide without the need to have any technical knowledge.
