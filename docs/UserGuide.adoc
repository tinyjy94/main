*Q*: How do I check that I have attached a document in a email? +
*A*: This feature is under development and it will be available in *v2.0*.

*Q*: Why can't I jump to a date before year 2000 or after year 2030? +
*A*: This is to facilitate our future enhancements which uses data after year 2000 for statistical analysis to predict the demand of movies.
In future versions, the hard limit on year 2030 will be raised to allow cinema managers to plan further ahead.

*Q*: Why is the maximum number of theaters only 20? +
*A*: This is to ensure that the schedules of the cinemas are displayed properly. If we allow cinema managers to add
any number of theaters, there is a possibility that the cinema's schedule is not displayed properly and this will be addressed in a later version.
